# Pom Atom UI theme

A dark theme for Atom that you might like or might hate or whatever I dunno.

You can install this by running
`apm install pom`

Once installed, this theme can be activated by going to
the _Themes_ section in the Settings view (`cmd-,`) and selecting it from the
_UI Themes_ drop-down menu.
